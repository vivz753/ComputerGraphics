# Computer Graphics

## CSE167X - Intro to Computer Graphics 

Enrolled July 2020

### Homework 1

Transform.cpp is where all the work is done.

Transform::rotate(), left(), up(), lookAt() were written by me.

Run `make` to compile
Run `./transforms` to execute the application
Run `./transforms input.txt` and press 'g' followed by 'i' to run the grader's script to take required screenshots

All done on my MacBookPro 2016 macOS Catalina
